KlusterFunk is a monitoring tool, built to visualize metrics from local kafka clusters, showing you a real-time, live-updating graph of those metrics.

You can find and use our application at https://klusterfunk-b05ffb62bc07.herokuapp.com/

## Overview

This is a tool meant for developers that are familiar with Kafka and how to export metrics. To use this tool we assume you have:

1. Implemented Prometheus' JMX exporter on your running Kafka cluster(s).
2. Set up a Prometheus instance including a yaml config file that is pulling metrics from the port where JMX exporter metrics are being exposed.
3. Port forward your Prometheus port so you can input the link in our app.

If you have not yet set up these tools for your clusters, follow the steps in **[Setup](#setup)**

## Setup

### To setup JMX exporter

- Build exporter:

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter.git
    cd jmx_exporter
    mvn package
```

- Start zookeeper:

```shell
  /usr/local/opt/kafka/bin/zookeeper-server-start /usr/local/etc/zookeeper/zoo.cfg
```

- Setup JMX exporter to run on Kafka (run from root) \

```shell
export EXTRA_ARGS="-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote \
    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false \
    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false \
    -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties \
    -javaagent:/Users/<username>/jmx_exporter/jmx_prometheus_javaagent/target/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.20.1-SNAPSHOT.jar=8081:/Users/<username>/jmx_exporter/example_configs/kafka-2_0_0.yml"
```

- Start kafka

```shell
/usr/local/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties
```

Localhost:8081 should now be displaying JMX metrics

- Run Prometheus and point it to scrape at port 8081 (or whatever port you configured the JMX exporter )
